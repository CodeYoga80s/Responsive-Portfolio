            <h3>Background, Interest, and career</h3>

            <p>Born in New Delhi, India, I came to the U.S. in the early 90s. My parents, siblings, and I have lived in the DMV area ever since.
            I also completed all my schooling locally. </p>
            
            <p>I am an avid practitioner of Yoga and Meditation and enjoy reading up on the subject during my free time. 
            I developed this interest after a friend pointed me towards them during a difficult time in my life and I have been hooked ever since given how much it helped me. 
            Using what I learn during the boot camp, I would like to create a website where I can share my development as a Yoga practitioner and share some tips or materials on Meditation. </p>

            <p>My career started off in the mortgage industry and I have stayed in it the entire time. 
            I am a senior valuation analyst and my expertise include, but not limited to, the valuation of Mortgaged Backed Securities (MBS) of various types including structured and non-structured products. 
            I have always had an analytical mindset and been interested in data analytics, so my current job suits my interests. </p>

            <p>My job required the use of various tools such as MS Office Suite, Bloomberg, Intex, and Tableau to name a few. 
            Being in a senior and leadership role, I am also involved in various initiatives related to the future state of our organization. 
            I am also an active member of the Diversity and Inclusion, D and I, committee in our organization as I believe equal opportunity and fair treatment at work is a must for all. </p>
